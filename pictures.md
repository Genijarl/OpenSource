Pictures of the robot we have used for this project -

You can build your robot how ever you like, but we found this build with a typical "shopping cart wheel" in the back to be most effective 
when working with sharp turns. This way the robot can turn close to 360 degrees on the spot with little wiggle room. 
The module in between the two front wheels is a color/light sensor which can seperate colors, and help the robot make intelligent decisions 
on when and where to turn. This is a spesifically important function as the project largely entails following a black line on a white canvas.
The frontside white/gray "arms" function as a mobile holder, where as you can connect your pc with your phone on appear.in while e.g., deploying 
the remote control /drive.py file. This is both fun and functional as you can drive out of sight, and still have control of the robot surroundings.
We are surprised how far the bluetooth module in the old lego robot can reach!
