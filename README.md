# LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT

“LEGO® MINDSTORMS® NXT for Education enables students to build and program
real-life robotic solutions. It provides cross-curricular
opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics. It allows for creativity in design and it
enables students to explore the world of engineering by
building complex control systems.”

# Goals of the project.

The goal for our project is to create two separate modules for the Lego Mindstorms NXT.
One module should contain the ability to remote control the robot using the keyboard on the computer.
The other module will be a line follower. The goal for this module is for the nxt robot to follow a 
black line automatically using the nxt light sensor. 

# Sources

We have used [Eelviny](https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python) nxt-python repository for installation
and as a guideline throughout this school project so check it out for further information
before continuing on this project. You will need to download a zip file from this repository. All modifying of these
source codes fall under GNU General Public License v3.0 [License](https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python/blob/master/LICENSE)

# Requirements

- LEGO Mindstorms NXT
- Windows 10 operating system 
- Bluetooth on your computer
- Pybluez (see the installation guide below)
- Python 2.7 (see the installation guide below)

# Installation guide

As we have only worked on Windows OS, this installation guide is only for computers using
the Windows operating system.
PS: Only tested on Windows 10!

1. Follow this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/) and download
the file named "Windows x86 MSI installer" to download Python 2.7.15 (This is the version
we have used)

2. Download the [v2.2.2](https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python/releases) zip file.
All credit on the work on this file should be given to the contributors of the nxt-python project.

3. Extract the zip file to a location of your choice (we used desktop) and double click the install.bat.
If a command module opens and scroll text, the installation is successfull.

4. Download the PyBluez-0.20.win32-py2.7.exe version of [PyBluez](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pybluez/downloads)
and follow the installation guide.

5. Try out our codes! You can find them [here](https://github.com/Genijarl/OpenSource/tree/master/src)
